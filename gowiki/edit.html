<!--
Template directives are enclosed in double curly braces:
The .Title and .Body dotted identifiers refer to p.Title and p.Body where p is
a parameter of the Execute method.
The printf "%s" .Body instruction is a function call that outputs .Body as a
string instead of a stream of bytes, the same as a call to fmt.Printf.
The html/template package helps guarantee that only safe and correct-looking
HTML is generated by template actions. For instance, it automatically escapes
any greater than sign (>), replacing it with &gt;, to make sure user data does
not corrupt the form HTML.
